Below are some example UML diagrams in [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax that you can adapt or expand for your project. These illustrate key system interactions, data flows, and components.

---

### 1. Use Case Diagram

```mermaid
%% Use Case Diagram
flowchart LR
    A(Client) -->|Submit case, view status| B(Clinic System)
    C(Solicitor) -->|View available cases| B
    C -->|Take/Release a case| B
    D(Admin) -->|Manage users, produce reports| B
```

**Key points:**
- Show the main actors: Client, Solicitor, Admin.  
- Outline their primary interactions (e.g., “Submit case,” “Manage users,” etc.).

---

### 2. High-Level Architecture Diagram

```mermaid
%% High-Level Architecture Diagram
flowchart LR
    subgraph Frontend
        React[React App]
    end

    subgraph Backend
        Node[Node/Express]
        DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    end

    React --> Node
    Node --> DB
```

**Key points:**
- Represent front end (React), back end (Node/Express), and the database (PostgreSQL).  
- Show data flowing from the user’s browser to the backend and storage in the database.

---

### 3. Class Diagram (Simplified)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
      +id : number
      +email : string
      +password : string
      +role : string
    }
    class Case {
      +caseId : number
      +title : string
      +description : string
      +timestamps() : void
    }
    class Note {
      +noteId : number
      +contents : string
      +isPrivate : boolean
    }

    User "1" --> "*" Case : "client/solicitor association"
    Case "1" --> "*" Note : "has notes"
```

**Key points:**
- Focus on the major classes (User, Case, Note).  
- Show the cardinality (one-to-many, etc.).

---

### 4. Sequence Diagram (Client Submitting a New Case)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Client
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    Client->>Frontend: Fill case details
    Frontend->>Backend: POST /cases
    Backend->>DB: INSERT new case record
    DB-->>Backend: Return success
    Backend-->>Frontend: Case created
    Frontend-->>Client: Confirmation message
```

**Key points:**
- Illustrate the request flow when a client submits a new case.  
- Show database insertion and completion feedback.

---

### 5. Deployment Diagram (Docker Containers)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Host Machine
        direction TB
        A[Frontend Container\n(port 3333)] --> B[Backend Container\n(port 5555)]
        B --> C[Postgres Container\n(port 5432)]
    end
```

**Key points:**
- Show how your three containers (Frontend, Backend, Database) communicate.  
- Note ports and container relationships.

Use these diagrams or outline structures as starting points. You can refine them using your own tool (e.g., [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/), [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), or UML software) to adapt text, relationships, and classes to fit your exact workflow.
